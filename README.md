Conversion of Crystal coordinate to Cartesian Coordinate
This program convert Crystal coordinate for Hexagonal lattice (possibly can be applied with others)
I am presenting a example of R3C structure of BiFeO3 (cif file is taken from Materials Project).
Lattice vectors of Hexagonal lattice are in terms of lattice constant a_0 and c0 are
a_1 = 1.0  0.0  0.0
a_2 = -0.5 $dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ 0.0
a_3 = 0.0 0.0 $\dfrac{c_0}{a_0}$

with $\alpha = 90$, $\beta = 90$ and $\gamma = 120$
